#### Code Inspiration ####

This plugin was partially inspired either in "code or concept" by the open-source software and discussions mentioned below:

* [Download Plugins Dashboard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-plugins-dashboard/)
* [Download Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-plugin/)
* [WP Theme Plugin Download](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-theme-plugin-download/)
* [Export Plugins And Templates](https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-plugins-and-templates/)

#### Admin Notices ####

This plugin generates multiple [Admin "Nag" Notices](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices#Disable_Nag_Notices) in the WP Admin dashboard. The first one fires during plugin activation which recommends several free plugins that we believe will enhance this plugin's features; this notice will re-appear once every 6 months as our code and recommendations evolve. The second is a notice that fires a few days after plugin activation which asks for a 5-star rating of this plugin on its WordPress.org profile page. This notice will re-appear once every 9 months. These notices can be dismissed by clicking the **(x)** symbol in the upper right of the notice box. These notices may annoy or confuse certain users, but are appreciated by the majority of our userbase, who understand that these notices support our free contributions to the WordPress community while providing valuable (free) recommendations for optimizing their website.

If you feel these notices are too annoying, we encourage you to consider one or more of our upcoming premium plugins that combine several free plugin features into a single control panel, or even consider developing your own plugins for WordPress, if supporting free plugin authors is too frustrating for you. A final alternative would be to place the following defined constant in your `wp-config.php` or `functions.php` file to manually hide this plugin's nag notices:

    define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);

Note: This will only affect the nag notices mentioned above, and will not affect any other notices generated by this plugin or other plugins, such as one-time notices for admin-level users.
